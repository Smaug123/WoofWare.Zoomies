# WoofWare.Zoomies

An [immediate-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)) [terminal user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) library using a [virtual DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOM) sort of approach.

Ultimately it is intended to incorporate something like Jane Street's [bonsai](https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai) to ensure the incremental update of UI elements is as efficient as possible.
